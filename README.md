# What's Cooking - Kaggle Competition

The interface for understanding everything in this project is the IPython Notebook contained in the root directory.

### Package Dependencies

In order to successfully run everything in the IPython Notebook, change to the project directory in your Terminal and run the following installation commands:

    pip install re
    pip install string
    pip install time
    pip install json
    pip install distance
    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install -U scikit-learn
    pip install pandas
    pip install collections
    pip install scipy
    pip install scikit-neuralnetwork
    pip install lasagne
    pip install ipycache

Please note that the ".pkl" files in the root directory are just cached Python variables kept to avoid re-executing tedious processes when unnecessary.

Additionally, please note that all the data and predictive results are stored in the "data" directory.

Now, open the IPython Notebook in the root directory and begin.
